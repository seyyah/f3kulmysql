PHP Fat-Free Framework Blog Demo

This demo should give you an idea of how easy it is to design and write an MVC-based application using Fat-Free. Please refer to the this blog's source code, import files and associated HTML templates for more information. The files contain a lot of inline documentation to help you understand how the application works and how the code interacts with the framework.

Login credentials for the blog demo are hard-coded. Use the following to test drive the system:-

	User ID: admin
	Password: admin

If you downloaded this file alone from SourceForge, you're missing the entire Fat-Free package which includes the quick reference, a CAPTCHA font and the text equivalent of the online documentation. Head over to http://sourceforge.net/projects/fatfree/files/ to download the zip archive. The filename follows the format:-

	fatfree-x.x.x.zip

Do not just copy this demo over a previous one. Your cache may contain deprecated remnants and the database in this new version may have been restructured. Delete all files in the containing folder and replace with this new version.
